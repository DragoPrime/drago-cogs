# DragoCogs
Cogs for personal use for Red Discord Bot.

[p]repo add drago-cogs https://github.com/DragoPrime/drago-cogs

[p]cog install drago-cogs [cog]

Note:
- Some cogs will be in romanian language. If you want to use them, fork them and translate them in your language.
- These cogs are made with Claude.AI. I don't know any coding, so support from me is useless.
